@brief OOI LCA architecture project

@package lcaarch OOI skeleton project

@mainpage

This is an OOI skeleton or example project, where the idea is that you check it
out from Git, modify it for your module and start hacking.

@section intro Introduction

The OOI coding standards, build system and such are getting a bit complex, so
it seems a good to provide sampe code and project. This has
 - Doxyfile for doxygen documentation, with examples of message sequence charts
 - Unit test suite, guaranteed to pass
 - Correct setup.py and setup.cfg (Build, packaging, dependencies) with example metadata

@subsection mscg Message sequence chart

MSCs can be quite handy for showing how components communicate, and Doxygen can
generate them for you on the fly.

@msc
 a, b, c;
 a -> b [label="msg frm a to b"];
 a <- c [label="c to a"];
 a <- b [label="b to a"];
@endmsc

@section doxy Doxygen

Note that you will need to spend a bit of time learning Doxygen. The most useful
tags will probably be note, bug, todo and see.

@note Notes are super handy.
@bug This project lacks an affine transform.
@see http://ooici.net/
@todo Conquer the world
