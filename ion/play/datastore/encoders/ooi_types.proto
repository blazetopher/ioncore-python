//Google protocol buffer implementation of OOI primitive types and
//structures.
// 
//The set of types and this mapping to proto buffer types is exploratory,
//and more about proving the mechanism than providing a final design.

//One message definition per ooi datatype might appear excessive and raise
//concerns of bloated encodings, but since protobuffers is not self
//describing and since the names aren't included in the encoding, the final
//result is small encodings. Anything that wants to encode/decode an ooi
//type or Data Object needs the google protobuffers library and this proto
//file, and that is it. 
//Other derived types/structures can be managed separately.
